Choosing animations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that the player can move, we need to change which animation the
AnimatedSprite is playing based on direction. We have a "right"
animation, which should be flipped horizontally using the ``flip_h``
property for left movement, and an "up" animation, which should be
flipped vertically with ``flip_v`` for downward movement.
Let's place this code at the end of our ``_process()`` function:

.. tabs::
 .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

        if velocity.x != 0:
            $AnimatedSprite.animation = "right"
            $AnimatedSprite.flip_v = false
            # See the note below about boolean assignment
            $AnimatedSprite.flip_h = velocity.x < 0
        elif velocity.y != 0:
            $AnimatedSprite.animation = "up"
            $AnimatedSprite.flip_v = velocity.y > 0

 .. code-tab:: csharp

        if (velocity.x != 0)
        {
            animatedSprite.Animation = "right";
            // See the note below about boolean assignment
            animatedSprite.FlipH = velocity.x < 0;
            animatedSprite.FlipV = false;
        }
        else if(velocity.y != 0)
        {
            animatedSprite.Animation = "up";
            animatedSprite.FlipV = velocity.y > 0;
        }

.. Note:: The boolean assignments in the code above are a common shorthand
          for programmers. Consider this code versus the shortened
          boolean assignment above:

          .. tabs::
           .. code-tab :: gdscript GDScript

             if velocity.x < 0:
                 $AnimatedSprite.flip_h = true
             else:
                 $AnimatedSprite.flip_h = false

           .. code-tab:: csharp

             if velocity.x < 0:
                 animatedSprite.FlipH = true
             else:
                 animatedSprite.FlipH = false

Play the scene again and check that the animations are correct in each
of the directions. When you're sure the movement is working correctly,
add this line to ``_ready()``, so the player will be hidden when the game
starts:

.. tabs::
 .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

    hide()

 .. code-tab:: csharp

    Hide();

Preparing for collisions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We want ``Player`` to detect when it's hit by an enemy, but we haven't
made any enemies yet! That's OK, because we're going to use Godot's
*signal* functionality to make it work.

Add the following at the top of the script, after ``extends Area2d``:

.. tabs::
 .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

    signal hit

 .. code-tab:: csharp

    // Don't forget to rebuild the project so the editor knows about the new signal.

    [Signal]
    public delegate void Hit();

This defines a custom signal called "hit" that we will have our player
emit (send out) when it collides with an enemy. We will use ``Area2D`` to
detect the collision. Select the ``Player`` node and click the "Node" tab
next to the Inspector tab to see the list of signals the player can emit:

.. image:: img/player_signals.png

Notice our custom "hit" signal is there as well! Since our enemies are
going to be ``RigidBody2D`` nodes, we want the
``body_entered( Object body )`` signal; this will be emitted when a
body contacts the player. Click "Connect.." and then "Connect" again on
the "Connecting Signal" window. We don't need to change any of these
settings - Godot will automatically create a function in your player's script.
This function will be called whenever the signal is emitted - it *handles* the
signal.

.. tip:: When connecting a signal, instead of having Godot create a
         function for you, you can also give the name of an existing
         function that you want to link the signal to.

Add this code to the function:

.. tabs::
 .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

    func _on_Player_body_entered(body):
        hide()  # Player disappears after being hit.
        emit_signal("hit")
        $CollisionShape2D.call_deferred("set_disabled", true)

 .. code-tab:: csharp

    public void OnPlayerBodyEntered(PhysicsBody2D body)
    {
        Hide(); // Player disappears after being hit.
        EmitSignal("Hit");
        GetNode<CollisionShape2D>("CollisionShape2D").Disabled = true;
    }

Each time an enemy hits the player, the signal is going to be emitted. We need
to disable the player's collision so that we don't trigger the ``hit`` signal
more than once.

.. Note:: Disabling the area's collision shape can cause an error if it happens
          in the middle of the engine's collision processing. Using ``call_deferred()``
          allows us to have Godot wait to disable the shape until it's safe to
          do so.

The last piece for our player is to add a function we can call to reset
the player when starting a new game.

.. tabs::
 .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

    func start(pos):
        position = pos
        show()
        $CollisionShape2D.disabled = false

 .. code-tab:: csharp

    public void Start(Vector2 pos)
    {
        Position = pos;
        Show();
        GetNode<CollisionShape2D>("CollisionShape2D").Disabled = false;
    }


Enemy scene
-----------

Now it's time to make the enemies our player will have to dodge. Their
behavior will not be very complex: mobs will spawn randomly at the edges
of the screen and move in a random direction in a straight line, then
despawn when they go offscreen.

We will build this into a ``Mob`` scene, which we can then *instance* to
create any number of independent mobs in the game.

Node setup
~~~~~~~~~~

Click Scene -> New Scene and we'll create the Mob.

The Mob scene will use the following nodes:

-  :ref:`RigidBody2D <class_RigidBody2D>` (named ``Mob``)

   -  :ref:`AnimatedSprite <class_AnimatedSprite>`
   -  :ref:`CollisionShape2D <class_CollisionShape2D>`
   -  :ref:`VisibilityNotifier2D <class_VisibilityNotifier2D>` (named ``Visibility``)

Don't forget to set the children so they can't be selected, like you did with the
Player scene.

In the :ref:`RigidBody2D <class_RigidBody2D>` properties, set ``Gravity Scale`` to ``0``, so
the mob will not fall downward. In addition, under the
``PhysicsBody2D`` section, click the ``Mask`` property and
uncheck the first box. This will ensure the mobs do not collide with each other.

.. image:: img/set_collision_mask.png

Set up the :ref:`AnimatedSprite <class_AnimatedSprite>` like you did for the player.
This time, we have 3 animations: ``fly``, ``swim``, and ``walk``. Set the ``Playing``
property in the Inspector to "On" and adjust the "Speed (FPS)" setting as shown below.
We'll select one of these animations randomly so that the mobs will have some variety.

.. image:: img/mob_animations.gif

``fly`` should be set to 3 FPS, with ``swim`` and ``walk`` set to 4 FPS.

Like the player images, these mob images need to be scaled down. Set the
``AnimatedSprite``'s ``Scale`` property to ``(0.75, 0.75)``.

As in the ``Player`` scene, add a ``CapsuleShape2D`` for the
collision. To align the shape with the image, you'll need to set the
``Rotation Degrees`` property to ``90`` under ``Node2D``.

Enemy script
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add a script to the ``Mob`` and add the following member variables:

.. tabs::
 .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

    extends RigidBody2D

    export var min_speed = 150  # Minimum speed range.
    export var max_speed = 250  # Maximum speed range.
    var mob_types = ["walk", "swim", "fly"]

 .. code-tab:: csharp

    public class Mob : RigidBody2D
    {
        // Don't forget to rebuild the project so the editor knows about the new export variables.

        [Export]
        public int MinSpeed = 150; // Minimum speed range.

        [Export]
        public int MaxSpeed = 250; // Maximum speed range.

        private String[] _mobTypes = {"walk", "swim", "fly"};
    }

When we spawn a mob, we'll pick a random value between ``min_speed`` and
``max_speed`` for how fast each mob will move (it would be boring if they
were all moving at the same speed). We also have an array containing the names
of the three animations, which we'll use to select a random one. Make sure
you've spelled these the same in the script and in the SpriteFrames resource.

Now let's look at the rest of the script. In ``_ready()`` we randomly
choose one of the three animation types:

.. tabs::
 .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

    func _ready():
        $AnimatedSprite.animation = mob_types[randi() % mob_types.size()]

 .. code-tab:: csharp

    // C# doesn't implement GDScript's random methods, so we use 'System.Random' as an alternative.
    static private Random _random = new Random();

    public override void _Ready()
    {
        GetNode<AnimatedSprite>("AnimatedSprite").Animation = _mobTypes[_random.Next(0, _mobTypes.Length)];
    }

.. note:: You must use ``randomize()`` if you want
          your sequence of "random" numbers to be different every time you run
          the scene. We're going to use ``randomize()`` in our ``Main`` scene,
          so we won't need it here. ``randi() % n`` is the standard way to get
          a random integer between ``0`` and ``n-1``.

The last piece is to make the mobs delete themselves when they leave the
screen. Connect the ``screen_exited()`` signal of the ``Visibility``
node and add this code:

.. tabs::
 .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

    func _on_Visibility_screen_exited():
        queue_free()

 .. code-tab:: csharp

    public void OnVisibilityScreenExited()
    {
        QueueFree();
    }

This completes the `Mob` scene.

Main scene
----------

Now it's time to bring it all together. Create a new scene and add a
:ref:`Node <class_Node>` named ``Main``. Click the "Instance" button and select your
saved ``Player.tscn``.

.. image:: img/instance_scene.png

.. note:: See :ref:`doc_instancing` to learn more about instancing.

Now, add the following nodes as children of ``Main``, and name them as
shown (values are in seconds):

-  :ref:`Timer <class_Timer>` (named ``MobTimer``) - to control how often mobs spawn
-  :ref:`Timer <class_Timer>` (named ``ScoreTimer``) - to increment the score every second
-  :ref:`Timer <class_Timer>` (named ``StartTimer``) - to give a delay before starting
-  :ref:`Position2D <class_Position2D>` (named ``StartPosition``) - to indicate the player's start position

Set the ``Wait Time`` property of each of the ``Timer`` nodes as
follows:

-  ``MobTimer``: ``0.5``
-  ``ScoreTimer``: ``1``
-  ``StartTimer``: ``2``

In addition, set the ``One Shot`` property of ``StartTimer`` to "On" and
set ``Position`` of the ``StartPosition`` node to ``(240, 450)``.

Spawning mobs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Main node will be spawning new mobs, and we want them to appear at a
random location on the edge of the screen. Add a :ref:`Path2D <class_Path2D>` node named
``MobPath`` as a child of ``Main``. When you select ``Path2D``,
you will see some new buttons at the top of the editor:

.. image:: img/path2d_buttons.png

Select the middle one ("Add Point") and draw the path by clicking to add
the points at the corners shown. To have the points snap to the grid, make sure "Snap to
Grid" is checked. This option can be found under the "Snapping options"
button to the left of the "Lock" button, appearing as a series of three
vertical dots.

.. image:: img/draw_path2d.gif

.. important:: Draw the path in *clockwise* order, or your mobs will spawn
               pointing *outwards* instead of *inwards*!

After placing point ``4`` in the image, click the "Close Curve" button and
your curve will be complete.

Now that the path is defined, add a :ref:`PathFollow2D <class_PathFollow2D>`
node as a child of ``MobPath`` and name it ``MobSpawnLocation``. This node will
automatically rotate and follow the path as it moves, so we can use it
to select a random position and direction along the path.

Main script
~~~~~~~~~~~

Add a script to ``Main``. At the top of the script, we use
``export (PackedScene)`` to allow us to choose the Mob scene we want to
instance.

.. tabs::
 .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

    extends Node

    export (PackedScene) var Mob
    var score

    func _ready():
        randomize()

 .. code-tab:: csharp

    public class Main : Node
    {
        // Don't forget to rebuild the project so the editor knows about the new export variable.

        [Export]
        public PackedScene Mob;

        private int _score;

        // We use 'System.Random' as an alternative to GDScript's random methods.
        private Random _random = new Random();

        public override void _Ready()
        {
        }

        // We'll use this later because C# doesn't support GDScript's randi().
        private float RandRange(float min, float max)
        {
            return (float)_random.NextDouble() * (max - min) + min;
        }
    }

Drag ``Mob.tscn`` from the "FileSystem" panel and drop it in the
``Mob`` property under the Script Variables of the ``Main`` node.

Next, click on the Player and connect the ``hit`` signal. We want to make a
new function named ``game_over``, which will handle what needs to happen when a
game ends. Type "game_over" in the "Method In Node" box at the bottom of the
"Connecting Signal" window. Add the following code, as well as a ``new_game``
function to set everything up for a new game:

.. tabs::
 .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

    func game_over():
        $ScoreTimer.stop()
        $MobTimer.stop()

    func new_game():
        score = 0
        $Player.start($StartPosition.position)
        $StartTimer.start()

 .. code-tab:: csharp

    public void GameOver()
    {
        GetNode<Timer>("MobTimer").Stop();
        GetNode<Timer>("ScoreTimer").Stop();
    }

    public void NewGame()
    {
        _score = 0;

        var player = GetNode<Player>("Player");
        var startPosition = GetNode<Position2D>("StartPosition");
        player.Start(startPosition.Position);

        GetNode<Timer>("StartTimer").Start();
    }

Now connect the ``timeout()`` signal of each of the Timer nodes (``StartTimer``,
``ScoreTimer`` ,and ``MobTimer``) to the main script. ``StartTimer`` will start
the other two timers. ``ScoreTimer`` will increment the score by 1.

.. tabs::
 .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

    func _on_StartTimer_timeout():
        $MobTimer.start()
        $ScoreTimer.start()

    func _on_ScoreTimer_timeout():
        score += 1

 .. code-tab:: csharp

    public void OnStartTimerTimeout()
    {
        GetNode<Timer>("MobTimer").Start();
        GetNode<Timer>("ScoreTimer").Start();
    }

    public void OnScoreTimerTimeout()
    {
        _score++;
    }

In ``_on_MobTimer_timeout()``, we will create a mob instance, pick a
random starting location along the ``Path2D``, and set the mob in
motion. The ``PathFollow2D`` node will automatically rotate as it
follows the path, so we will use that to select the mob's direction as
well as its position.

Note that a new instance must be added to the scene using
``add_child()``.

Now click on ``MobTimer`` in the scene window then head to inspector window,
switch to node view then click on ``timeout()`` and connect the signal.

Add the following code:

.. tabs::
 .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

    func _on_MobTimer_timeout():
        # Choose a random location on Path2D.
        $MobPath/MobSpawnLocation.set_offset(randi())
        # Create a Mob instance and add it to the scene.
        var mob = Mob.instance()
        add_child(mob)
        # Set the mob's direction perpendicular to the path direction.
        var direction = $MobPath/MobSpawnLocation.rotation + PI / 2
        # Set the mob's position to a random location.
        mob.position = $MobPath/MobSpawnLocation.position
        # Add some randomness to the direction.
        direction += rand_range(-PI / 4, PI / 4)
        mob.rotation = direction
        # Set the velocity (speed & direction).
        mob.linear_velocity = Vector2(rand_range(mob.min_speed, mob.max_speed), 0)
        mob.linear_velocity = mob.linear_velocity.rotated(direction)

 .. code-tab:: csharp

    public void OnMobTimerTimeout()
    {
        // Choose a random location on Path2D.
        var mobSpawnLocation = GetNode<PathFollow2D>("MobPath/MobSpawnLocation");
        mobSpawnLocation.SetOffset(_random.Next());

        // Create a Mob instance and add it to the scene.
        var mobInstance = (RigidBody2D)Mob.Instance();
        AddChild(mobInstance);

        // Set the mob's direction perpendicular to the path direction.
        float direction = mobSpawnLocation.Rotation + Mathf.Pi / 2;

        // Set the mob's position to a random location.
        mobInstance.Position = mobSpawnLocation.Position;

        // Add some randomness to the direction.
        direction += RandRange(-Mathf.Pi / 4, Mathf.Pi / 4);
        mobInstance.Rotation = direction;

        // Choose the velocity.
        mobInstance.SetLinearVelocity(new Vector2(RandRange(150f, 250f), 0).Rotated(direction));
    }

.. important:: In functions requiring angles, GDScript uses *radians*,
               not degrees. If you're more comfortable working with
               degrees, you'll need to use the ``deg2rad()`` and
               ``rad2deg()`` functions to convert between the two.

HUD
---

The final piece our game needs is a UI: an interface to display things
like score, a "game over" message, and a restart button. Create a new
scene, and add a :ref:`CanvasLayer <class_CanvasLayer>` node named ``HUD``. "HUD" stands for
"heads-up display", an informational display that appears as an
overlay on top of the game view.

The :ref:`CanvasLayer <class_CanvasLayer>` node lets us draw our UI elements on
a layer above the rest of the game, so that the information it displays isn't
covered up by any game elements like the player or mobs.

The HUD displays the following information:

-  Score, changed by ``ScoreTimer``.
-  A message, such as "Game Over" or "Get Ready!"
-  A "Start" button to begin the game.

The basic node for UI elements is :ref:`Control <class_Control>`. To create our UI,
we'll use two types of :ref:`Control <class_Control>` nodes: :ref:`Label <class_Label>`
and :ref:`Button <class_Button>`.

Create the following as children of the ``HUD`` node:

-  :ref:`Label <class_Label>` named ``ScoreLabel``.
-  :ref:`Label <class_Label>` named ``MessageLabel``.
-  :ref:`Button <class_Button>` named ``StartButton``.
-  :ref:`Timer <class_Timer>` named ``MessageTimer``.

Click on the ``ScoreLabel`` and type a number into the _Text_ field in the
Inspector. The default font for ``Control`` nodes is small and doesn't scale
well. There is a font file included in the game assets called
"Xolonium-Regular.ttf". To use this font, do the following for each of
the three ``Control`` nodes:

1. Under "Custom Fonts", choose "New DynamicFont"

.. image:: img/custom_font1.png

2. Click on the "DynamicFont" you added, and under "Font/Font Data",
   choose "Load" and select the "Xolonium-Regular.ttf" file. You must
   also set the font's ``Size``. A setting of ``64`` works well.

.. image:: img/custom_font2.png

.. note:: **Anchors and Margins:** ``Control`` nodes have a position and size,
          but they also have anchors and margins. Anchors define the
          origin - the reference point for the edges of the node. Margins
          update automatically when you move or resize a control node. They
          represent the distance from the control node's edges to its anchor.
          See :ref:`doc_design_interfaces_with_the_control_nodes` for more details.

Arrange the nodes as shown below. Click the "Anchor" button to
set a Control node's anchor:

.. image:: img/ui_anchor.png

You can drag the nodes to place them manually, or for more precise
placement, use the following settings:

ScoreLabel
~~~~~~~~~~

-  *Text* : ``0``
-  *Layout* : "Top Wide"
-  *Align* : "Center"

MessageLabel
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  *Text* : ``Dodge the Creeps!``
-  *Layout* : "HCenter Wide"
-  *Align* : "Center"

StartButton
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  *Text* : ``Start``
-  *Layout* : "Center Bottom"
-  *Margin* :

   -  Top: ``-200``
   -  Bottom: ``-100``

Now add this script to ``HUD``:

.. tabs::
 .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

    extends CanvasLayer

    signal start_game

 .. code-tab:: csharp

    public class HUD : CanvasLayer
    {
        // Don't forget to rebuild the project so the editor knows about the new signal.

        [Signal]
        public delegate void StartGame();
    }

The ``start_game`` signal tells the ``Main`` node that the button
has been pressed.

.. tabs::
 .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

    func show_message(text):
        $MessageLabel.text = text
        $MessageLabel.show()
        $MessageTimer.start()

 .. code-tab:: csharp

    public void ShowMessage(string text)
    {
        var messageLabel = GetNode<Label>("MessageLabel");
        messageLabel.Text = text;
        messageLabel.Show();

        GetNode<Timer>("MessageTimer").Start();
    }

This function is called when we want to display a message
temporarily, such as "Get Ready". On the ``MessageTimer``, set the
``Wait Time`` to ``2`` and set the ``One Shot`` property to "On".

.. tabs::
 .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

    func show_game_over():
        show_message("Game Over")
        yield($MessageTimer, "timeout")
        $MessageLabel.text = "Dodge the\nCreeps!"
        $MessageLabel.show()
        yield(get_tree().create_timer(1), 'timeout')
        $StartButton.show()

 .. code-tab:: csharp

    async public void ShowGameOver()
    {
        ShowMessage("Game Over");

        var messageTimer = GetNode<Timer>("MessageTimer");
        await ToSignal(messageTimer, "timeout");

        var messageLabel = GetNode<Label>("MessageLabel");
        messageLabel.Text = "Dodge the\nCreeps!";
        messageLabel.Show();

        GetNode<Button>("StartButton").Show();
    }

This function is called when the player loses. It will show "Game
Over" for 2 seconds, then return to the title screen and, after a brief pause,
show the "Start" button.

.. note:: When you need to pause for a brief time, an alternative to using a
          Timer node is to use the SceneTree's ``create_timer()`` function. This
          can be very useful to delay, such as in the above code, where we want
          to wait a little bit of time before showing the "Start" button.

.. tabs::
 .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

    func update_score(score):
        $ScoreLabel.text = str(score)

 .. code-tab:: csharp

    public void UpdateScore(int score)
    {
        GetNode<Label>("ScoreLabel").Text = _score.ToString();
    }

This function is called by ``Main`` whenever the score changes.

Connect the ``timeout()`` signal of ``MessageTimer`` and the
``pressed()`` signal of ``StartButton``.

.. tabs::
 .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

    func _on_StartButton_pressed():
        $StartButton.hide()
        emit_signal("start_game")

    func _on_MessageTimer_timeout():
        $MessageLabel.hide()

 .. code-tab:: csharp

    public void OnStartButtonPressed()
    {
        GetNode<Button>("StartButton").Hide();
        EmitSignal("StartGame");
    }

    public void OnMessageTimerTimeout()
    {
        GetNode<Label>("MessageLabel").Hide();
    }

Connecting HUD to Main
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that we're done creating the ``HUD`` scene, save it and go back to ``Main``.
Instance the ``HUD`` scene in ``Main`` like you did the ``Player`` scene, and
place it at the bottom of the tree. The full tree should look like this,
so make sure you didn't miss anything:

.. image:: img/completed_main_scene.png

Now we need to connect the ``HUD`` functionality to our ``Main`` script.
This requires a few additions to the ``Main`` scene:

In the Node tab, connect the HUD's ``start_game`` signal to the
``new_game()`` function.

In ``new_game()``, update the score display and show the "Get Ready"
message:

.. tabs::
 .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

        $HUD.update_score(score)
        $HUD.show_message("Get Ready")

 .. code-tab:: csharp

        var hud = GetNode<HUD>("HUD");
        hud.UpdateScore(_score);
        hud.ShowMessage("Get Ready!");

In ``game_over()`` we need to call the corresponding ``HUD`` function:

.. tabs::
 .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

        $HUD.show_game_over()

 .. code-tab:: csharp

        GetNode<HUD>("HUD").ShowGameOver();

Finally, add this to ``_on_ScoreTimer_timeout()`` to keep the display in
sync with the changing score:

.. tabs::
 .. code-tab:: gdscript GDScript

        $HUD.update_score(score)

 .. code-tab:: csharp

        GetNode<HUD>.UpdateScore(_score);

Now you're ready to play! Click the "Play the Project" button. You will
be asked to select a main scene, so choose ``Main.tscn``.

Finishing up
------------

We have now completed all the functionality for our game. Below are some
remaining steps to add a bit more "juice" to improve the game
experience. Feel free to expand the gameplay with your own ideas.

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

The default gray background is not very appealing, so let's change its
color. One way to do this is to use a :ref:`ColorRect <class_ColorRect>` node.
Make it the first node under ``Main`` so that it will be drawn behind the other
nodes. ``ColorRect`` only has one property: ``Color``. Choose a color
you like and drag the size of the ``ColorRect`` so that it covers the
screen.

You could also add a background image, if you have one, by using a
``Sprite`` node.

Sound effects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sound and music can be the single most effective way to add appeal to
the game experience. In your game assets folder, you have two sound
files: "House In a Forest Loop.ogg" for background music, and
"gameover.wav" for when the player loses.

Add two :ref:`AudioStreamPlayer <class_AudioStreamPlayer>` nodes as children of ``Main``. Name one of
them ``Music`` and the other ``DeathSound``. On each one, click on the
``Stream`` property, select "Load", and choose the corresponding audio
file.

To play the music, add ``$Music.play()`` in the ``new_game()`` function
and ``$Music.stop()`` in the ``game_over()`` function.

Finally, add ``$DeathSound.play()`` in the ``game_over()`` function.

Keyboard Shortcut
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since the game is played with keyboard controls, it would be convenient if we
could also start the game by pressing a key on the keyboard. One way to do this
is using the "Shortcut" property of the ``Button`` node.

In the ``HUD`` scene, select the ``StartButton`` and find its _Shortcut_ property
in the Inspector. Select "New Shortcut" and click on the "Shortcut" item. A
second _Shortcut_ property will appear. Select "New InputEventAction" and click
the new "InputEvent". Finally, in the _Action_ property, type the name "ui_select".
This is the default input event associated with the spacebar.

Now when the start button appears, you can either click it or press the spacebar
to start the game.
